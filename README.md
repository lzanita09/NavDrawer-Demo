## Navigation drawer demo for CS4760/5760 at MTU

Just a simple demo for navigation drawer.

Note that I used Android Studio to write the code, if you want to use it in Eclipse, just copy the src, res and AndroidManifest.xml to your project. You also need to include the android-support-v4.jar into your project. 

The guideline for android-support-v4.jar setup can be found [here](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html).
